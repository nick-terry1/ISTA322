1. The view is stateless because it can assume any form of the model.  

2. view models, which just represent data being transferred between views and controllers; or they can be domain models, which contain the data in a business domain as well as the operations, transformations, and rules for manipulating that data

3. Seperation of concerns in everyday life is like keeping work and personal life seperated. 

4. A view engine is the component responsible for processing a view in order to generate a response for the browser. 

5. Its the most widely used because the unit testing is easier, no constraints on how the UI is implimented 
and has seperation of concerns without being complicated. 

6. MVVM is client side and two way binds data within views, whereas MVC is server side and uses three way seperation. 

7. Two parts of dependency interjection is removing dependencies on concrete classes 
from the component, and injecting dependencies declared by the class when the instance is created. 

8. An example of loose coupling in everyday life is like a faucet that has hot and cold water and both 
can work independently but they also work together. 

9. Two types of testing discussed in the book are unit testing and integration testing. 

10. Seven steps to Test Driven Development are 1) determine that you need to add a new feature or method to your application, 
2) write the test that will validate the behavior of the new feature when it is written. 3) run the test and get a red light. 
4) write the code that implements the new feature. 5) run the test again and correct the code until you get a green light. 
6) refactor the code if required. 7) run the test to confirm that your changes have not changed the behavior of your additions.
