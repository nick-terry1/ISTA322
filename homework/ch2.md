1. In MVC architecture, incoming requests are handled by controllers. In ASP.NET MVC, controllers are just C# classes.

2. names given to controllers should indicate their purpose; the default controller is called Home and controller names have the suffix Controller. 
HomeController.cs is the default controller.

3. RouteConfig.cs in the AppStart folder. 

4. Razor is a view engine, which processes the contents of views and generates HTML that is sent to the browser. The @ tells razor that you dont want to use a layout. 

5. A view method runs a method on the specific view as opposed to simply printing to the browser. 

6. The model is the representation of the real-world objects, processes, and rules that define the subject, known as the domain, of the application.

7. A strongly typed view is typing what type model you specifically want to work with instead of leaving the option blank, and will automatically make a razor expression for you.

8. The purpose is to send the user to a specific page instead of a default. 

9. Http get recieves data and http post posts a response after the data is recieved. 

10. You could add required fields like [Reqired], or add a styles sheet. 

11. Cascading style sheets are for making individual pages correspond to individual style sheets.
